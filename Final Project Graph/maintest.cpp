1. Create some tests before you start coding...

2. Implement a graph class with at least:

    - a function to add a new vertex to the graph (perhaps add_vertex(vertex_name))

    - a function to add a new edge between two vertices of the graph (perhaps add_edge(source, destination) or source.add_edge(destination))

    - a function for a shortest path algorithm (perhaps shortest_path(source, destination))

    - a function for a minimum spanning tree algorithm (example min_span_tree()).

3. Analyze the complexity of all of your graph behaviors
